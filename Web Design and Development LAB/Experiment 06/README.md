>> Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
>>
>> AJAX is not a programming language.
>>
>> AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers from a web page.
>>
>> Asynchronous programming : Back to back i.e., blocking calls are not there. All the calls are going on in the background. DOM rendering is not getting blocked.
>>
>> Normal programming that we do are synchronous i.e., has blocking calls in it, i.e., until the previous lines are not completed/executed, next lines are not executed.  
>>
>> Modern websites use JSON instead of XML for data transfer.
>>
>> So, AJAX helps in fetching data asynchronously without interfering with the existing page.
>>
>> Benefits:
>> >No page reload/refresh
>> >Better user experience
>> >Saves network bandwidth (by requesting only the required portion of the website)
>> >Very interactive
